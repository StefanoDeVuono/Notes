csrf
 = Cross Site Request Forgery

 Eg, I have a form that I have on my website that points to facebook
  I claim it'll dislike me, but it'll actually send a like

 It does something on someone else's website

 To prevent this we have an authenticity token

 input type hidden name authenticity-token value = fwuqpoh09384
 input type submit

 So a server that is hosting a site with a form that posts to another resource on the site does this:
 A request to form
 B server generates random token, stores in DB
 C form returned
 D user submits form POST to like
 E server looks up token in DB - VERIFICATION!
 F Throws out cookie if verification fails
 * B ad E are done automatically by rails

 If I go through my own form, I don't have auth token from server.
 If user doesn't have to log in, it ain't no thang, but a chicken wang.
 With a logged in user, no cookie means that my controllers post method would not trigger a like.

 Doesn't actually store it's token in DB, rather generates it with a digital signature.

put this in your form and now it works!
 <input type="hidden" value="<% form_authenticity_token %>">
the server will no longer delete your session
